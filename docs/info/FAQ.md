# FAQ

## General

### How do I request a change to a reference image / video? How can I request to add a new image / video?
If there's an issue with a reference image or video, or you would like to see new references added, please submit an issue on our GitHub page!

[Unclear Reference Image / Video Issue Template](https://github.com/glitchingdot/OW-Model-Wiki/issues/new?template=unclear-reference-image---video.md)

Fill out the provided template, press Create, and it will notify us! We'll try to get back to you as soon as possible!

### Why are some images and videos not loading?
Each page contains a decent amount of photos and videos to provide an adequate amount of details. This does mean, however, that loading it can take a little bit longer than expected. If you already know which reference image / video you would like to see, try clicking on the **Open in Full Size** link. That will skip loading the other images and videos!

## Models

### Can you give me models from Outer Wilds?
No can do. Outer Wilds, similar to most all modern games, doesn't permit the explicit sharing of
models, textures, or assets from the game outright. 

### Is it possible to extract models from Outer Wilds?
Totally! There's many guides about extracting models from Unity games, so making our own here would
probably be reduntant. Give it a Google!
